Today, I'll be talking about Higher Education and some of the changes we made in 2022 before moving on to what we’re doing now, all of which will make this part of Pearson more competitive and more successful. I want to start off by saying that we’ve got some really good strengths in Higher Education: incredible IP, great author relationships, deep expertise in learning technology, strong relationships with faculty, and of course a small little thing called Pearson Plus.  However, we haven’t been as commercial from an organizational, sales, service, product, and cultural perspective as we need to be.  Addressing each one of these will help us tackle adoption losses and recapture the secondary market over time. There are five things we are doing to increase competitiveness: bringing in new talent, reducing fixed costs, setting up a new product-led operating model, investing in sales, and transforming our product.  Since August of 2022, we have changed the leadership team with four new hires, and we have reduced the number of senior roles by 30% to increase accountability.   Alongside our other cost initiatives, we have made major structural efficiency savings and delivered margin expansion in 2022.  We should see further operating leverage in the future. Alongside the reductions in fixed costs, we continue to invest in our key growth drivers, in particular our go-to-market strategy.  As I mentioned, we are implementing a new product-led operating model in the first half of 2023.  General managers will now be responsible for revenue growth, product profitability, and building successful franchises like Campbell’s Biology, Tro’s Chemistry, and Triola’s statistics. At the same time, we are working on product transformation.  Our new go-to-market strategy will be driven by a reorganized and larger sales team, designed to improve the win rate of new adoptions and drive much higher renewal rates in our existing business.  Our core team will continue to focus on five key disciplines: math, business, science, computer science, and engineering, where we already have strong market positions, and the potential to win new adoptions.  They will be complimented by a customer loyalty team to manage renewals for lower-value, high-penetration existing business with a focus on retention. We will also have a team entirely focused on winning new business in white-space, high-potential departments, and we are developing our coverage for professional disciplines (teacher education, nursing) with a larger, dedicated team, and we are doubling all efforts to cover disciplines such as English, Humanities, and Social Sciences. From the product perspective, in 2022 we migrated Mastering to the cloud, and this year we’re migrating MyLabs to the cloud.  Through this, we’re enhancing stability and performance and driving a better user experience.  And building on these initiatives, we’re going to focus on four key areas: converging and upgrading our courseware platforms, simplifying Inclusive Access integration strategies, building out our digital learning learning experiences, and driving improvements in product stability.  We are launching three interactive MyLabs titles in Calculus,  Algebra, and Statistics this Fall, and we are also launching new MyLabs in Biology and Microbiology with Anatomy and Physiology to follow in 2024.  And of course, we now have 18 study channels to grow Pearson Plus, which helps widen our total addressable market and helps us with secondary market recapture. We are simplifying, and reducing the number of Inclusive Access integration models we have to make our offering more competitive, and that includes the adoption of Pearson Plus in IA models for roughly a third of our schools this Fall.   And we are building out our digital learning experiences to deliver more interactive and personalized learning experiences and to take a digital-first content creation approach.  Finally, we are focused on improving the stability of our core learning experiences.`
